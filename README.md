# LameIt
A simple RISC OS GUI frontend to LAME, using the FrontEnd module.

This requires LAME and the FrontEnd module to be installed, and Lame$Dir to be set to the path of the LAME executable.
Due to the framework this is made with, there are currently a number of limitations, most notably that the file type
is not set properly to AMPEG on export. If you know how to solve this please drop me a line, but this was intended
solely to be an educational exercise in using the FrontEnd module.
